Multiverse Crew you know what to do here: File a pull request to add content. File an issue to request content.

We need:
- links to free resources to handle maslow's hierarchy of needs organized by layer (folder structure `needs/base/food.md` or `needs/community/lgbtq.md`)
- links to communities organizing around specific issues organized by region (folder structure : `communities/TX/abortion_access.md` or `communities/NC/flood_relief.md`)
- mutual aid groups organized by region (folder structure : `mutual_aid/CA/buy_nothing.md`)
- links to free educational resources (a folder called education with top-level documents organized by category)
- cybersecurity protocols (folder structure: `cybersecurity_protocols/print_antifash_propaganda_safely.md`) these will be the fastest moving targets so we'll need to keep an eye on these.
- antifacist propaganda and memes to share (folder structure: `propaganda/category/meme`, name the source, screenshotting is the safest way to save images, no links to x) 
- unbiased news sources (a folder called news sources with links organized by category)
- problem-solution pairings (this should probably be a folder called problems with a folder for each problem and some remediation steps or protocols in different files)
